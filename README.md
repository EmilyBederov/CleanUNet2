# Pytorch Implementation of CleanUNet2

This repo contains non-official PyTorch implementation of [CleanUNet 2: A Hybrid Speech Denoising Model on Waveform and Spectrogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05975). CleanUNet 2 uses a two-stage framework inspired by popular speech synthesis methods that consist of a waveform model and a spectrogram model. The model is optimized
through a set of losses defined over both waveform and multi-resolution spectrograms. The proposed method outperforms the CleanUNet: [Speech Denoising in the Waveform Domain with Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07790).

## Datasets

This code is adapted to use any dataset containing clean audios, and during training data augmentation is applied to create a version with noises. Therefore, just create the .csv file and include it in the config.json. As an example, there is a version using the [LJSpeech-1.1](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) dataset. The transcripts are not required. The filelists can be found at:

```
filelists/ljs_audio_text_train_filelist.txt
filelists/ljs_audio_text_test_filelist.txt
filelists/ljs_audio_text_val_filelist.txt
```

In `config.json`, just include the path to the csv files:

```
"trainset_config": {
    "data_dir": "../DATASETS/LJSpeech-1.1/",
    "train_metadata": "./filelists/ljs_audio_text_train_filelist.txt",
    "test_metadata": "./filelists/ljs_audio_text_val_filelist.txt",
```

For data augmentation, a basic configuration is already included in `config.json`:

```
        "augmentations": [
            {
                "name": "Mp3Compression",
                "params": {
                    "min_bitrate": 128,

                }

                    "max_snr_in_db": 30.0,
                    "p": 0.2
                }
            },  
            {
                "name": "AddGaussianSNR",
                "params": {
                    "min_snr_in_db": 15,
                    "max_snr_in_db": 30,
                    "p": 0.2
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "LowPassFilter",
                "params": {
                    "min_cutoff_freq": 4000,
                    "max_cutoff_freq": 7000,
                    "p": 0.2
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "HighPassFilter",
                "params": {
                    "min_cutoff_freq": 400,
                    "max_cutoff_freq": 2000,
                    "p": 0.2
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "ApplyImpulseResponse",
                "params": {
                    "ir_path": "/path/to/sound_folder",
                    "p": 0.2
                }
            }            
        ]  
```

## Training

The ```$EXP``` variable can be any config name in ```./configs/```, such as ```config.json```. The default experiment path is salved at ```./logs_training/cleanunet2```; it can be changed by modifying ```train_config[log[directory]]``` in the config files. ```trainset_config[root]``` needs to be set as the root path of the dataset. Then, the training code is

```python3 train.py -c configs/config.json```

It is recommended to pre-train the CleanUNet and CleanSpecNet models and use the checkpoints in CleanUNet2. To do this, simply configure the file paths in config.json:

```
        "checkpoint_cleanunet_path": "./checkpoints/cleanunet/pretrained.pkl",
        "checkpoint_cleanspecnet_path": "./checkpoints/cleanspecnet/pretrained.pkl",
```
## Fine Tuning

To perform finetuning, you can include the path to the checkpoint in config.json:

```
"checkpoint_path": "./checkpoints/pretrained.pkl",
```

and run the training:

```python train.py -c configs/config.json```
